# java-travis-tests

Instructions for assignment goes here

Students will code in repl.it or other environment (at your own risk for installing java, jdk, junit, hamcrest-core, compiling and running java files)

Main is for the sake of repl.it and allows students to run their program or test their code.
Tests will always be in \*Test.java, where \* is the name of the main class file.
